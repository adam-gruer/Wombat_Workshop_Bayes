# Diagnostics

## Diagnostics

This is a light overview of diagnostics, for more resources on this, please see:

-   https://mc-stan.org/bayesplot/articles/visual-mcmc-diagnostics.html

-   https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/rstan_workflow.html

## The eight schools example

-   The most common example for demonstrating diagnostic issues in Stan in the Eight schools data. A basic model is used for it that has known and well-understood sampling issues.

-   We cannot replicate these issues in brms because brms codes the model in such a way to avoid them (I will discuss this a little more in part 3)

## Sampling warning 1: Divergent transitions

Looks like:

## Sampling warning 1: Divergent transitions

Can I ignore it?

-   1/2 can be a type 1 error (false positive). More than this can indicate sampling issues which means that your posterior might not be fully sampled.

## Sampling warning 1: Divergent transitions

What does it mean?

-   We often use the framing of walking over a large hill. On steeper sections, you need to take smaller steps to avoid falling down the hill. However, if you took the same size step on a flat area, it would be very slow. The divergent transition is akin to "falling down the hill" - which means a part of the parameter space is harder to sample from.

## Sampling warning 1 : Divergent transitions

How do I fix it:

(Conditional on working in brms)

-   Check the model is appropriate for the data
    -   Do the priors make sense or they very different from realistic values

    -   Is the formula specified correctly (aka have you listed or not listed a variable twice?)

    -   Is the model possible to identify given the data you have

## Sampling warning 1 : Divergent transitions

How do I fix it:

-   Increase adapt_delta to be closer to 1 - (default is 0.8)

    -   If a smaller step size reduces the problem, it is likely that you can sample from the posterior, but this will be slower.

    -   If it does not, it is likely an issue with your model specification and/or data. Time to get some help! :)

## Sampling warning 2: Treedepth

HMC requires trajectories over your parameter space. Stan approximates these trajectories numerically using a fixed number of discrete values. When the spaces is very complex (or impossible), it will use more values. This is capped at 1024 (default for max tree depth = 10). You can increase this, it will become very slow. Generally these warnings indicate something else is going on with the model.

## Sampling warning 3: Rhat

-   Compares within vs between chains for parameters. If they do not agreee, Rhat is greater than 1 and indicates the chains have not mixed well.

-   To identify this, please use 4 chains.

-   The standard cut-off is 1.01 for finalised results.

-   What to do if you get an Rhat warning? Generally it means something has been poorly specified or there's an issue with the model.

## Sampling warning 4: Effective sample size

-   Effective sample size is an estimate of the number of independent draws your posterior is equivalent to.

-   In Stan there are two warnings based on the ESS:

    -   Bulk-ESS: sampling efficiency for location summaries (>400 suggested if using 4 chains)
    -   Tail-ESS: sampling eddiciency of 5% and 95% quantiles
