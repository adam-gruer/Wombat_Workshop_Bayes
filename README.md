## **Bayesian Inference and regression using R and Stan**

Welcome to the Bayesian Inference and regression workshop using R and Stan!

For efficiency in the workshop, please install or attempt to install the following in a recent version of R (4.2 or higher) before the workshop. I recommend doing this in the following order.

-   The tidyverse (used for general data manipulation)

-   cmdstanR (used to run Stan models)

-   CmdStan through this package. There is a good instruction page in the [installation vignette](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html). Sometimes setting file paths can be tricky on managed computers. Please let me know if you have issues

-   Other useful packages in the Stan family include posterior, bayesplot and shinystan

- You will also need access to lmeresampler for a dataset in part 3.

This workshop will assume that you are familiar with linear regression (including formula notation) and are comfortable working in R using the tidyverse.
